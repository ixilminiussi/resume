# How To
### Edit
1. Make sure you have [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/) installed on your device.
2. Run in background using
  ```bash
  sass --watch style.scss style.css
  ```
3. Edit index.html, look at the current model to infer structure. Remove unnecessary sections, create new as needed, move them between left and right.
4. Edit the variables declared in style.scss to make the page fit nicely. Feel free to modify the rest of the css at your own risk
5. View the page by opening it with your favorite browser (using an automatic page refresh addon is recommended) or VSCode live preview
6. Use the Download bottom on the page to download it as a pdf
